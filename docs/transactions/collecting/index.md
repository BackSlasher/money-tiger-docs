# Collecting

Without transactions, the site is uselss, so collecting transactions is a crucial funcionality of the site.  
Due to the complex beaurocracy of acquiring transactions directly from the banks / CC companies, I currently rely on scraping externally.

This is a detailed explenation of how to set up transaction collection.

You can track all of the submitted imports [🐯 import runs](https://www.money-tiger.tech/txns/runs)

You can either:

* Let the website handle the workload (see [Internally](internal.md))
* Keep your credentials to yourself, and be in charge of scraping (see [Externally](external.md))

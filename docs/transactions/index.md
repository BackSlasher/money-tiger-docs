# Transactions

Transactions are the main functionality of the site.
Each transaction represents a "line" in your credit card bill, or your bank account history page.

## Collecting

## Removing
There is no way to remove transactions at the moment.
Let me know if this is a feature you'd like to have.

## Editing
You cannot edit a transaction. Instead, you can add some metadata to it, like a category, receipt or note.
